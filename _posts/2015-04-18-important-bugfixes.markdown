The audio and channel tree including nested recycling tree was completely revised. Many important bugfixes followed. This was not at least a chance for me to harden the API.

You may for now link, unlink, hot-link and swap link with the machine's property dialog by opening engine's context menu.

Since me have spent much time on it, we have to date back again for oncomming release 0.4.3.

Download fix version: [ags-0.4.2-50][ags-0_4_2-50]
