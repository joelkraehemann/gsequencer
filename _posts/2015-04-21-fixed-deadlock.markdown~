There was important fix to 0.4.2, `ags` didn't release a mutex as returning from initializing alsa as the soundcard was busy. So initialization failed ended in a dead-lock. This is fixed for now.

You may await the next fix version where me doing a clean version without any compiler warnings, hope so.
