Download of Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer version 0.4.2-45 available, now. Most concurrency problems should be fixed. But me don't feel satisfied about stability. For example can still crash the engine by resizing input of a running machine like AgsMatrix or AgsDrum.

But the good thing is bank indices are fixed, for now. Further AgsDrum got a new look, mainly labeling of indices and pattern editor changed.
