Me did some real code clean up. Fixed almost every warning around and found several bugs. Just with the peak, I'm not satisfied. May be me adopt some LADSPA code.
Or probably me having even for this a solution.

Now me doing some extensive testing and as result we should get some screencasts.

If you're interested in testing as well let me know ...
