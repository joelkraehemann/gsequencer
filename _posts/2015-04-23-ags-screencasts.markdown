Hi all, me just did some screencasts during testing of Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer. I got the chance fix some bugs therefor.

These examples were all loaded by using XML file IO from command line started. As mentioned restoring works fully supported.

The first screencast shows you AgsMatrix in action. Selecting different banks, modify first oscillator from sinus to sawtooth wave and at last some pitch.

During the second screencast AgsDrum is used extensively to by selecting banks, modifying pattern or doing playback using AgsPad's play button.
